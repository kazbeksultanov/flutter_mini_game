Mini Game's Readme file!
===================

Building 
===============
Building and running this project do not require anything special. Simply build and run. I don't have Mac so I tested it only on Android devices.
Game Logic
======================
This mini-game is in mode PvP for 2 players. The aim is to shot and kill the enemy. There are red and blue players which shown as filled circles.  The second big circle is a jumpable area where at the tap, the nearest player will go there. A circular area between second and the third circles is shooting area where a direction is identified by the player's position and tap point on shot area. Shot distance is constant and not infinite. The first player to hit the opponent will win the round. After you will be given a choice to keep score or restart it.

Actually, I planned that it should be played by internet online real players vs real player but unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish this on time. So decided to submit what I have.# flutter_mini_game
